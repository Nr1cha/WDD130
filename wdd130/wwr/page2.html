                    welcome to the second page of the dry oar site, this is the first sub-page that will showcase a blog
                    for any
                    users that wish to post about any adventures that they experiance. this should page can include 
                    as many paragraphs that express the topics that want to be covered. this page should also include
                    pictures of the adventure and should also mark the people that are in the pictures to ensure that readers
                    can identify information about the trip and for the purpose of linking any of the information to a 
                    family history website, things will be easily recognizable.

                    this blog post should have information that is relevent to the activity, and show a consistant
                    format that is
                    shown across all blog posts for users to be able to digest the information quickly. the resources
                    that should be mentioned
                    in the posts are any names of people, the location that was visited including on which day that it
                    was visited on and the gear
                    that was used while on the trip. the other information that is also helpful would be map coordinates
                    of the location, this is to ensure
                    that areas that don't have an address can be viewed by users who would like to explore the areas
                    that were mentioned.
