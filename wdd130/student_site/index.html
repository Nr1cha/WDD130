                <p class="para-1">Hello my name is Nick Richards and i recently started school full time at BYU Idaho in the Applied
                    Technology Major.
                    I first started in the BYU Pathways program where i just recently came from. i started out there
                    going back to
                    school trying to get back into higher education. it's been about 10+ years or so since i graduated
                    high school and
                    served a mission in the Virginia Richmond mission. i've worked full time both in the student loan
                    financial field and
                    shortly thereafter, the IT Support field where i worked on building computers on the side for fun
                    while supporting
                    several hundred users in the corprate financial sector. after getting married, i started the
                    Pathways program to ease
                    myself into the college scene again and build necessary habits needed for a successful college
                    career.
                    on the side, i've built small websites for fun on the FreeCodeCamp site and a few Udemy cources and
                    have now found myself
                    doing this full time after a brief web development internship for the church of jesus christ of
                    latter-day saints.
                </p>
                <p class="para-2">This site is meant to be a mock-up of a portfolio for all developers
                    alike. this is to ensure that a standard can be established for software engineers of any kind to
                    not only have a fast turn around time
                    between jobs, but a place that they can post the required information that many companies need to
                    find quality people that work well with
                    their culture.
                    This current site is mainly just a quick draft of what the standard portfolio will look like without
                    the page for background information.
                    what sets this type of template aside from sites like linkedin or indeed is that it's a site that an
                    engineer can feel like they can make it
                    their own over time, updating it regularly with experiance and projects.
