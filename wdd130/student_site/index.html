                <p class="para-1">Hello, my name is Nick Richards and I recently started school full-time at BYU Idaho
                    in the Applied Technology Major. I first started in the BYU Pathways program where I just recently
                    came from. I started there by going back to school trying to get back into higher education. It's
                    been about 10+ years or so since I graduated high school and served a mission in the Virginia
                    Richmond Mission. I've worked full-time both in the student loan financial field and shortly
                    thereafter, in the IT Support field where I worked on building computers on the side for fun while
                    supporting several hundred users in the corporate financial sector. After getting married, I started
                    the Pathways program to ease myself into the college scene again and build the necessary habits
                    needed for a successful college career. On the side, I've built small websites for fun on the
                    FreeCodeCamp site and a few Udemy courses and have now found myself doing this full time after a
                    brief web development internship for the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints.
                </p>
                <p class="para-2">This site is meant to be a mock-up of a portfolio for all developers alike. This is to
                    ensure that a standard can be established for software engineers of any kind to not only have a fast
                    turnaround time between jobs but a place where they can post the required information that many
                    companies need to find quality people that work well with their culture. This current site is mainly
                    just a quick draft of what the standard portfolio will look like without the page for background
                    information. What sets this type of template aside from sites like LinkedIn or indeed is that it's a
                    site that an engineer can feel like they can make their own over time, updating it regularly with
                    experience and projects.
