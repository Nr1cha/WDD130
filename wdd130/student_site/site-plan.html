      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been in the process of recruiting a web developer for your company and later found 
        yourself lost in social media websites mixed with sorting out their job history to determine if they are 
        the right fit for your company? What I do is make websites for developers that will showcase their 
        portfolios and serve as a platform for the information that employers need, such as most recent 
        employment history, social media links, and educational achievements, enabling employers to get the 
        right person for the job.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>my intended audiance is going to be fellow developers but mainly job recruiters because. i want to address them because 
        i want to find a way that they can make really quick but great choices about who they hire for the intended job. 
        knowing what they look for to be the most efficient when finding the right person and being able to midigate the amount of looking they 
        will need to do when finding a candidate will be very useful. if they can be sold on this particular plan, i would think that 
        companies would adopt this formula. this will improve the overall quality of finding a job in a large market for large companies as well 
        as freelancers.

      <p class="heading-words">Why come to my site than other sites or services?</p>
      <p>The products we offer will allow veterans to the field of development as well as new and upcoming developers, to build out their website portfolio site with ease and confidence knowing that when they are finished, the end result is a product that they can be proud of that represents their personality, just the way they like.</p>

      <h3>The Product</h3> <!--page 2-->

      <p class="heading-words">Purpose of product</p>
      <p class="word-body">The unity web portfolio is a service that is similar to wix or square-space only its main purpose for people looking to work in the field of development/programming it offers a concise list of pre-made templates that you can choose from and then begin filling out your information. Once that information is filled out and complete, the user selects a domain name and chosen hosting service to which the site is uploaded to. Why would this be a great thing for developers or programmers? It offers streamlined standardization for companies and recruiters alike to find the most accurate information when it comes to finding a potential candidate for their company. </p>

      <p class="heading-words">What information do you put on this site?</p>
      <p class="word-body">Its simple, the information you put on this site is mainly going to be superficial about you. And example of this Information will be about where you have lived (not your address but city and state) more specifically the history of where you have worked including a history of your education (this portion can be difficult as many people either choose schooling that is vocational or self taught) be sure to be very specific about your schooling and work history. The last section is going to be the main “selling point”. Its a section that shows the notable projects you have done in the past including projects that you currently maintain. </p>

      <!-- page 3 -->
      <h3>Q&A</h3> <!--page 3-->

      <p class="heading-words">Why not have a social media site dedicated to developers and programmers?</p>
      <p class="word-body">Thats what linkedin, indeed, and many other sites are for. Instead of saturating the existing market with yet another service that makes things more complicated to manage, its also a great option to ensure that both companies and employees around the world, dont have to transition to a whole new service or standard.</p>

      <p class="heading-words">How does it work for developers and programmers?</p>
      <p class="word-body">	Its simple, simply select a template from the site that allows you to then insert the information that you wish to include. Keep in mind that the more information that you add, the easier it will be for companies to review your information and explore your content. When your done with your content and fill out what your domain is and where you want to host it, the site is yours with no attachments to us. At that point, your free to keep it and maintain it at any time, we only ask that you use the provided link to attach to any social media site. That link differs from any other links that shows that you are using a standard that shows employers that your using website that shows the most recent, and consolidated information about you as a perspective employee.</p>

      <p class="heading-words">How will recruiters find you?</p>
      <p class="word-body">Recruiters in the industry use many different products and services, including several social networking sites to find the best candidate and look at the background of that person. The way they will find you best is if you attach our provided link to your site that shows the type of link it is which makes it easy for them to not only see on pages they scroll past but allows them to filter current sites and social networks for profiles for just those links. By attaching that link to your twitter, facebook, linkedin etc. your allowing companies to quickly search for you. </p>
