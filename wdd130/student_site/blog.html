            <h1>Interesting Programming Concepts</h1>
            <div class="blog-paragraphs">
                <p class="para-item">Planning the website. That was great in terms of seeing an overview of the 
                    material that we were going to cover, this also included an overview of CSS practice and the difficulties
                    that come with moving things around with that language.
                </p>
                <p class="para-item">GitHub page hosting. this was a great lesson because it included hosting our material 
                    on the GitHub page which I've not done before. this was great practice to ensure that I can also host my 
                    website portfolio online without paying for hosting while I'm still in school.
                </p>
                <p class="para-item">CSS Classes vs. IDs. this was great to go through and get a great refresher on the difference
                    between the two. Something nice is the ability to give a set of code, more than one class that way
                    I can style different things at different times. 
                </p>
                <p class="para-item">Wireframes are cool. I've not dealt with them myself and the only other person
                    that I knew that did was my mentor during my web development internship. he used paper and pencil mixed with 
                    a program that he used to create shapes. that seemed to work best for him and ended up working well for me. 
                </p>
                <p class="para-item">CSS Units of Measurement. this was great practice because depending on the unit that is used, 
                    it can have a really big effect on the main website as a whole when it comes to accessibility for certain users. 
                    the great thing is, that all units of measurement in CSS are needed.
                </p>
                <p class="para-item">SEO. something that I find interesting about a site is the SEO and the effect that it can have 
                    on the "life" of the website. I've seen publishers not know what it is or how it works and I've also seen somewhere 
                    they know exactly what it is and how it functions. it seems to me that it can make or break a site. I remember that one 
                    company years ago was sued for not having SEO or accessibility. 
                </p>
                <p class="para-item">CSS Grid vs Flex. what's great about CSS Grid or Flex is that they can be used in a variety of ways
                    to suit the needs of the company that is building a website. they both have their challenges and what I have often
                    found many other developers do is use the "!important" tag when working with responsive design. that can be  
                    frustrating especially when there are a few of those tags being used with that design because they mess up the scope 
                    of CSS and make troubleshooting anything with the scope difficult.
                </p>
                <p class="para-item">HTML tags. one thing that I've noticed over the years are the many ways that people can design a site.
                    with HTML there are several ways that a developer can build a site. but, what I have found helpful is the knowledge of certain tags like "article" for example which helps to design a website more in line with how we think. it 
                    helps to organize the data in a way that can make the site more accessible and easier to troubleshoot.
                </p>
                <p class="para-item">CSS Web Components. i remember the time that i was in my internship and the first week was a meeting about
                    the use of web componants. many of the publishing staff were excited about the design choices of them. one thing that i 
                    didn't know was that with some componants, accessibility can be really difficult to impliment. on top of being really fancy
                    they do indeed make a site more simple to navigate, which in turn, provides a degree of accessibility. 
                </p>
